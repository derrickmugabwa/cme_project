# Webinar Enrollment Units System Implementation

## Overview

The units system has been implemented to enable webinar enrollments based on a virtual currency (units). Users need sufficient units to enroll in webinars, and admins can manage unit requirements and top up user balances.

## Components Implemented

### Database Schema

A migration file has been created with the following tables:
- `user_units` - Tracks user unit balances
- `session_enrollments` - Records webinar enrollments and units spent
- `session_unit_requirements` - Defines units required per webinar session
- `unit_transactions` - Records all unit-related transactions

**Note: The migration has not been executed yet and requires your explicit approval.**

### API Endpoints

#### User APIs
- `/api/units` - Get current user's unit balance
- `/api/units/transactions` - Get user's unit transaction history
- `/api/sessions/[id]/enroll` - Enroll in a webinar session
- `/api/sessions/[id]/enrollment-status` - Check enrollment status and unit requirements

#### Admin APIs
- `/api/admin/units/topup` - Top up user units
- `/api/admin/sessions/[id]/unit-requirement` - Get/update session unit requirements
- `/api/admin/profiles` - Get all user profiles with optional unit balances
- `/api/admin/sessions` - Get all sessions with optional unit requirements

### Frontend Components

#### User Components
- `UserUnitsWallet` - Displays unit balance and transaction history
- `EnrollButton` - Allows users to enroll in sessions if they have sufficient units

#### Admin Components
- `AdminUnitsManager` - Interface to search users and top up their units
- `SessionUnitRequirementManager` - Interface to manage unit requirements per session

### Pages

#### User Pages
- `/dashboard/units` - User's units wallet page

#### Admin Pages
- `/dashboard/admin/units` - Admin units management page with tabs for user units and session requirements

## Integration

The enrollment button has been integrated into the session detail page, allowing users to enroll in webinars if they have sufficient units.

## Next Steps

1. **Review and execute the database migration**
   - The migration file is located at `supabase/migrations/20250601_webinar_enrollment_units_system.sql`
   - Review the migration carefully before execution
   - Execute the migration using Supabase CLI or dashboard

2. **Test the units system**
   - Test user enrollment flows
   - Test admin unit management
   - Verify access control and permissions

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Integration with payment systems for purchasing units
   - Subscription models for automatic unit allocation
   - Reporting and analytics for unit usage

## Technical Notes

- The system uses atomic database functions to ensure data integrity during unit deductions and enrollments
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies protect user data and enforce access control
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with clear separation between user and admin routes
- Frontend components are designed for responsiveness using shadcn/ui
