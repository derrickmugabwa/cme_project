# Role Change Implementation Status: Student to User

## Overview

This document outlines the current status of the role change implementation from 'student' to 'user' throughout the application.

## Completed Changes

### UI Components

1. **Sign-Up Form**
   - Updated to use 'user' instead of 'student'
   - Changed display text from 'Student' to 'User'

2. **Profile Form**
   - Updated to use 'user' instead of 'student'
   - Changed display text from 'Student' to 'User'

3. **Profile Sidebar**
   - Updated role arrays to use 'user' instead of 'student'

4. **Dashboard Component**
   - Renamed StudentDashboard to UserDashboard
   - Updated imports and references

### Business Logic

1. **Content List Component**
   - Updated conditional logic to check for 'user' role instead of 'student'

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Updated to use 'user' role instead of 'student' where applicable

### Database Changes

1. **RLS Policies**
   - Updated policy names from "Students can..." to "Users can..."
   - Updated policy definitions to work with both 'student' and 'user' roles for backward compatibility

2. **handle_new_user Function**
   - Updated to use 'faculty' as a temporary default role

## Pending Changes

### Database Schema

The user_role enum type still contains 'student' instead of 'user' due to complex dependencies in the database. This requires a more comprehensive migration approach that includes:

1. Creating a new enum type with 'user' instead of 'student'
2. Creating a new profiles table with the new enum type
3. Migrating data from the old table to the new one
4. Updating all dependent functions and policies
5. Dropping the old table and enum type

This migration needs to be carefully planned and executed to avoid breaking existing functionality.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the application with the current changes to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that new users are assigned the correct role
   - Check that existing functionality works with the updated role names

2. **Database Migration**
   - Develop a comprehensive migration plan to update the user_role enum type
   - Consider using a temporary compatibility layer to support both 'student' and 'user' roles during the transition
   - Execute the migration during a maintenance window to minimize disruption

3. **Documentation**
   - Update all documentation to reflect the new role names
   - Provide guidance for developers on using the new role names in future code

## Conclusion

The role change from 'student' to 'user' has been partially implemented, with most UI components and business logic updated to use the new role name. The database schema changes are more complex and require additional planning and execution.

In the meantime, the application will continue to work with the existing database structure, with new code using 'user' instead of 'student' where possible.
